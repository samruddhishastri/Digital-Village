# Digital Village

## Overview
In rural India, most of the administration is handled manually and is often errorneous. We find long queues for payments at the Tahsildar office. Due to the limitations of human beings to multitask, village administration has become a fairly slow procedure. There are many applications for urban administration, but they cannot be used in villages due to different requirements and the low digital literacy of villagers.
