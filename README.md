# Digital Village

## Overview
In rural India, most of the administration is handled manually and is often errorneous. We find long queues for payments at the Tahsildar office. Due to the limitations of human beings to multitask, village administration has become a fairly slow procedure. There are many applications for urban administration, but they cannot be used in villages due to different requirements and the low digital literacy of villagers. The project tries to address this issue. It aims to digitalize administration procedures in Gram Panchayat (administration in rural India). It is an application, built to simplify complicated procedures such as announcements, complaint registration, payments, records of villagers, etc. It is constructed primararily keeping in view the working of Panchayat and the requirements of the villagers.   
There are two types of users who have can access this application: i) Villager ii) Admin.
Villagers can register complaints, view announcements, and make payments. Admin can see the complaints and change the status of the complaint according to the progress made. He can also create announcements, and set payment reminders. The project is coded using Flutter (for frontend), Django (backend), and PostgreSQL (database).
